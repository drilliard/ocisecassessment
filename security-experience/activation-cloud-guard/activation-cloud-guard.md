# Automatic activation of Cloud Guard

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to use your Security Dashboard to activate Cloud Guard.

### Objectives
* Go to your Security Dashboard
* Click to implement Cloud Guard from your Unique Security Experience tool

### What Do You Need?
This lab assumes that you have successfully completed the previous labs in the **Contents** menu on the right.

## Task 1: Automatic activation of Cloud Guard
In the APEX UI you can see which service is not used. In this case, you have a completely new OCI tenant, therefore you do not have any security service activated. Oracle recommends strongly to activate Cloud Guard as the first step for your OCI onboarding, to have a complete view of your OCI security.

1. Go to your security dashboard and click to the section Cloud Guard in the left menu:

  You will be able to view a dedicated page for Cloud Guard service, where you can see some descriptions about the functionality, features, benefits and overview of the service. At the same time, you have 3 buttons on the top of the page for different purposes:

  * **Go To OCI Cloud Guard Console**. If you click this button, you will be redirected to the Cloud Guard service in your OCI tenant, where you can enable the service in case it is disabled, or do some configurations if required.
  * **Go To OCI Cloud Guard Documentation**. If you click this button, you will be redirected to the Oracle public documentation for all information related to Cloud Guard, in case you want to know more details about the service.
  * **Turn on OCI Cloud Guard**. If you click this button, you will be able to activate Cloud Guard automatically in case the service is not activated. A Terraform script will load automatically, and you will be prompted to a console where you have to enter the mandatory parameters.
